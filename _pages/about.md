I am a theoretical and computational physicist with interest in spin-dependent phenomena in solid-state systems

I have experience in modeling electronic structure and spin-dependent transport in semiconductors and
device structures. Skilled in C++ and Python programming for scientific calculations and visualization
including for density-matrix evolutions and electric-field-induced dynamics. Also acquired extensive
experience during my PhD studies in ab initio calculations with commercial and open-source codes and managing
C++/MPI research codes.  These days I primarily work in C++ and Python, but I've written plenty of Fortran, Mathematica and Javascript in the past as well.

I worked at [QuantCAD](http://www.quantcad.com) as Principal Investigar (PI) in two NASA SBIR projects and one DARPGA award where I performed computational simulations of spin-dependent phenomena in semiconductors for quantum sensing applications and managed projects involving multiple teams from both industry and academia. I helped to write technical proposals for DOE, NSF, DARPA and NASA.

Duringy PhD work was on calculating 



My writings in [Blog](/blog) are on themes that interest me, mainly: physics, mathematics, programming, electronics and related stuff.
